# Top Songs Analysis
Data Analytics Bootcamp 2021 Final Project
**Topic:** Spotify Top 200 Charts Analysis 
**Project Questions:**
- What songs have the most streams?
- Which artists have the most streams?
- Which artists have the most songs on the chart?
- What songs have been #1 on the charts? 
- Which artists have the most #1 hits?
- Which songs are most danceable? Most energetic? Most positive-sounding (high valence)? 
- Can we predict if a song can break into the top 20 positions, based on the song's musical features?

**Data Source:** 
[Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional/us/daily/)
[Spotify - Web API - Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/discover/)
- Top 200 Charts, Daily
- Country: United States
- Timeframe: Jan. 1, 2021 - Nov. 17, 2021
